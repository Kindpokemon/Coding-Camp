		<p>The Fine Game of Nil is a Paper-and-Dice based RPG set in the Roaring 20's. 
		However, this world isn't quite like the normal one. 
		It is inhabited by, along with humans, 20ish other sentient species, hundreds of animals, and living gods. (It should be noted that actually seeing a god in the flesh is normally rare) 
		Not only that, but it is set in a universe made of planes floating in a vast cosmic space. 
		With airships, demons, heavan and hell, and beasts that crawled out of H.P. Lovecraft's writings, prepare for an epic group adventure! (If your DM isn't crap)
